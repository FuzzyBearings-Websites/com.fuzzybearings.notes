I've been working on building a simple kanban board for iOS.

There are a few out there so I'm not really trying to compete. My inspiration stems from several different _todo_ applications  &hellip;

- [Trello](http://trello.com/)
- [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com/)
- [The Hit List](http://www.karelia.com/products/the-hit-list/mac.html)
- [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear/)

I'm not sure where this will got but I'll be sure and post screenshots in the near future.
