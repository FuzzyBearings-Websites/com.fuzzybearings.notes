I've been creating and selling iPhone Apps under the moniker [Fuzzy Bearings](http://www.fuzzybearings.com/) for a while now and I've decided to try something different this year. 

In an effort to be more transparent and open the door to more opportunities, I am going to _publish_ my ideas, decisions and experiments as relates to efforts to make Fuzzy Bearings a financially viable entity.
