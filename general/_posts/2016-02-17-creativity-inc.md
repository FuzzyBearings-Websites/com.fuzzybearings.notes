I recently finished (thoroughly enjoyed) [Creativity, Inc](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FUZQYBO/). While certainly a very minor part of the book, I didn't realize it took so long to create animated movies. I didn't realize that some of those movies were 2, 3, &hellip; 4 years in the making. It got me to thinking about software. I thought of all the ideas I started and specifically, how long I worked on them before the ideas fizzled out. "I think I want to spend more time writing and designing sotware" I told msyelf.

I know, I know.

> This year is going to be different.

I think my most recent epiphany has been to consider how  This year I'm going to:

- build smaller applications
- publish my thoughts and work as we go
- consider strategic markets to target
- consider iterating on and building a platform
